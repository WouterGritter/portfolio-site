# Hello, world!

Programming has been my core passion since childhood, driving everything I do.
I thrive on building software solutions and love getting hands-on with
infrastructure and physical hardware â€“ there's something uniquely satisfying
about learning from tangible tech. This site showcases that journey: explore
my software projects, technical accomplishments, and the blog posts where
I dive deep into the how and why behind code I've written and projects I've worked on.
Be sure to check out the recently updated [Homelab](/homelab.md) section too, where I geek out on
datacenter gear, experiment with new stacks and tools, and tinker with
self-hosted setups to push my understanding further. Explore the sections
to the left to see my work.
