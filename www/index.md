# Hello, world!

My name is Wouter. Ever since I was a child I loved everything programming-related,
and I still do to this very day. On my little corner of the internet you can learn a bit
more about me regarding my hobbies, personal projects and accomplishments. Some of my projects
will have a blog-like post you can read if you're interested!

Be sure to check out the [Homelab](/homelab.md) page I recently updated.
